Coding for Economics

A place to learn and showcase my coding skills in R/Python/Matlab/Stata for economics. Top level topics are: Econometrics and Other Economics. The Other Economics code is going to have sub-topics as MacroEconomics and MicroEconomics. I am going to mostly focus on Econometrics and MacroEconomics codes with occasional additions in MicroEconomics.
